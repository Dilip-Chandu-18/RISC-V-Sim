Instructions:
-> Create a text file named "temp.txt" and populate it with the desired commands. Each command should be on a separate line.
-> Compile and run the program.
-> The program will read the "temp.txt" file and execute the commands.
-> After executing all the commands, the program will display the values stored in each register.

For Example,
add 1, 2 3
addi 4, 5 10
sub 3, 1 2
